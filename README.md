## Project Overview:
### Objective:
The overarching objective of our project is to leverage the Instacart dataset to gain insights into food purchasing behaviors – aiming to understand historical trends and predict future purchase behavior. This may an online food grocery store focused on essentials, potentially leading to a universal food package delivery system that caters to the general public.

### Project Introduction:
The Instacart dataset provides a detailed account of user purchase behaviors over time, offering rich information about food products, order sequence, and purchase timings. Through a deep dive into this dataset, we aim to:

Understand the essentials: What food products are most frequently bought by users?
Predict future purchases: Based on historical data, can we forecast future buying behaviors?
Inform a minimalist online food grocery store: If one were to create an 'essentials-only' store, what products should it carry?
Explore the feasibility of a universal food package: Can we curate a food package that caters to the broadest demographic? How often should it be delivered to be most effective?

### Project Dataset
This is a study of the Instacart dataset, made public with the goal to predict costomer reordering (jeremy stanley, Meg Risdal, sharathrao, Will Cukierski. (2017). Instacart Market Basket Analysis. Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis). Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonym
ized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order. Here is the link to the data set: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data.

### ETL (Extraction, Transform, Load) Process:
Extraction: CSV files were obtained directly from the Instacart competition page.
Transform: Data will undergo processes to handle missing values, ensure data tidiness, and merge tables for enriched information.
Load: Data frames, post transformation, will be structured for further analysis.

### Initial Analysis and Observations:
Understand the top products and categories from the dataset – are there patterns that highlight essential products?
Explore purchase frequencies – which products are consistently being bought over time?

### Deeper Analysis and Study Objectives:
- Essentials Identification: Through product frequency and popularity, determine a list of 'essential' food products.
- Predictive Analysis: Using past purchase data, attempt to predict future buying patterns.
- Online Grocery Store Blueprint: Based on the essential products identified, create a hypothetical inventory list for an online food grocery store focusing on essentials.
- Universal Food Package Design: Curate a universally appealing food package based on the most commonly bought items. Analyze order frequencies to determine optimal delivery schedules – weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.

### Collaboration Plan:
This project is structured as an individual endeavor. Git will be employed for version control, and all data, analysis, and findings will be hosted on GitHub. A systematic schedule will be adhered to, ensuring dedicated time slots for consistent project progress.

### Next Steps:
- Proceed with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Instacart dataset.
- Correlate findings with external data sources, such as nutritional databases, to add depth to the analysis.
- Design preliminary models for predictive analysis and test their efficacy.

### Website/GitHub IO Page:
Progress, including this Milestone 1 document and subsequent findings, will be updated on the GitHub IO page to ensure transparency and ease of reference.
